# Steering-Aware LIDAR Visualization Dashboard
This project displays real-time LIDAR data and the vehicleâ€™s steering angle to support navigation. It features a live table, a radar chart of the surroundings, and a car model that turns with the steering. This helps visualize the carâ€™s path and nearby objects, useful in robotics and autonomous vehicles.
## ðŸš€ Features
* Real-time data from a LIDAR sensor (TCP stream).
* Live updating data table and radar scanner view.
* Visual steering indicator based on angle.
