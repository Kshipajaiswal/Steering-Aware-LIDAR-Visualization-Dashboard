# Steering-Aware LIDAR Visualization Dashboard
This project displays real-time LIDAR data and the vehicleâ€™s steering angle to support navigation. It features a live table, a radar chart of the surroundings, and a car model that turns with the steering. This helps visualize the carâ€™s path and nearby objects, useful in robotics and autonomous vehicles.

## Introduction
This project presents a real-time dashboard designed to visualize LIDAR sensor data alongside a vehicleâ€™s steering angle. The system captures live TCP stream data from a LIDAR sensor and renders it into a responsive and interactive GUI.

Key elements of the dashboard include:
* A radar-style chart that visually represents the surrounding objects.

* A live-updating data table showing detailed angle, distance, and intensity values.

* A car model that turns to reflect real-time steering angle using Ackermann geometry.

This tool is highly useful for applications in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and mobile navigation systems, where understanding environmental layout and steering dynamics is crucial.


## Features
* Real-time data from a LIDAR sensor (TCP stream).
* Live updating data table and radar scanner view.
* Visual steering indicator based on angle.
* Flask backend + HTML/CSS/JS frontend.
* Responsive and interactive GUI layout.
